# ðŸŒ³ Synchronicity Engine â€” Glossary of Terms

<!-- path: /docs/glossary.md -->

Term	Definition
Intention	A living intention created by a player. It collects Blessings, Proofs of Service, and optionally attached Tokens of Gratitude that "boost" its visibility.
Blessing	A player's presence toward an Intention â€” recorded as an attention span. Each Blessing is a Token of Gratitude in "potential" status until assigned, then becomes "active" or "given".
Token of Gratitude (ToG)	A Blessing treated as a transferable asset. May nest hierarchically (parent + children). Stewardship changes upon assignment or acceptance in an Offering/Artifact flow.
Gratitude Potential	Numeric value of an Intention or Offering = Î£(durations of live Blessings) + Î£(durations of attached Tokens). Used for dashboard ranking.
Attention Switch	Timestamp written whenever a user changes focus from one Intention to another. Durations are always derived as the difference between consecutive switches.
Proof of Service	Verifiable evidence (text + media) that work was done toward an Intention. Triggers token assignment decisions by previous Blessing holders.
Offering	An opportunity (e.g., "Yoga in the Temple") with limited slots. Players bid by attaching Token baskets; steward accepts top offers, transferring token trees.
Artifact	A physical or virtual resource (temple, tool) donated into the Shared Shed (Sherd). Owned by an Original Steward but can be leased via sub-steward windows.
Sherd	"Shared Resource Shed" â€” registry UI showing local Artifacts available by request.
Steward	Current holder of a Token, Intention, or Artifact. The "Original Steward" is the first signer/owner of an Artifact.
Sub-Steward	A temporary caretaker of an Artifact during an approved time window.
Blessing Composer	UI textarea forcing a player to leave text before entering an Intention again; ensures every Blessing carries human context, not just hours.
Spotlight	Dashboard component surfacing top Intentions & Offerings sorted by Gratitude Potential.
Temple of Listening	Planned moderation layer to curate or filter Intentions when volume overwhelms attention. (Not in PoC scope.)
