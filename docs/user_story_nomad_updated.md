A background query runs:

// pseudo
offersWithinRadius(wayPoint.latlon, 50km)
  .filter(o => intersects(o.timeWindow, wayPoint.from, wayPoint.until))
  .filter(o => o.slotsAvailable > 0)

Result: Eco-Cabin Hideaway card appears in Sage's Dashboard Spotlight with "Matched to your Lisbon trip" tag.

4. Sage Bids with Tokens
	â€¢	Sage clicks the card â†’ sees details & Code of Ethics.
	â€¢	Opens Token Wallet â†’ drags a parent token + 2 children (total 6 h 30 m) into bid zone.
	â€¢	offeringsDB.put(updated document with tokenOffers.push({ userId:'sage', topToken:'tok_sage_main' }))

Engine ranks Sage #1 (only bidder).

5. Host Accepts Bid

Marisol receives a notification, opens Offering detail, reviews Sage's profile & ethics agreement, then clicks Accept.

System calls:

flattenTokenTree('tok_sage_main', blessingsDB)
  .forEach(id => {
    const blessing = blessingsDB.get(id);
    blessing.value.stewardId = 'marisol';
    blessingsDB.put(blessing.value);
  });
offeringsDB.put({
  ...offering,
  status:'fulfilled',
  selectedStewards:['sage'],
  slotsAvailable:0
});

Toast to Sage:

"Your Gratitude basket has secured the Eco-Cabin, 20 â€“ 24 Sep. See you soon!"
