# ðŸš€ Synchronicity Engine â€” Proof-of-Concept Sprint 0 Roadmap

<!-- path: /docs/roadmap_sprint0.md -->

(14-day intensive build)

Goal: a clickable demo on a single laptop (IPFS daemon + local mailer) that exercises every core mechanic: create intention, track attention, assign tokens, post proof, bid & accept offering, request artifact stewardship.

Day-by-Day Tasks

Day	Deliverable	Notes / Acceptance
1	Repo scaffold (pnpm + Vite React + Tailwind) Â· IPFS node spin-up Â· OrbitDB dependency	npm run dev shows blank page; ipfs daemon reachable
2	Auth server (/invite, /magic-link) Â· Nodemailer stub	Magic link lands on /#/welcome?token= storing JWT
3	Orbit identity (load JWT âžž OrbitDB.identity) Â· initOrbit() hook	Browser console: identities attached
4	Create Intention modal + useCreateIntention(); write to intentionsDB, blessingsDB, attentionSwitchesDB	Form submit pops "Intention Planted" panel
5	Attention listener (route change â†’ attention:switch event) Â· Toast component	Close app / reopen preserves index array
6	Intention Detail page timeline (Blessing nodes & Proof nodes)	Demo shows 1 Blessing entry
7	Blessing composer + unassigned token panel	"Bless" button appends new Blessing ID
8	Proof of Service upload (local image to IPFS) Â· proof modal	Proof card appears in timeline
9	Assign Token flow (right-panel â†’ assign)	Token status flips to given
10	Create Offering page + bid drag-n-drop	Second user account can submit bid
11	Accept bid logic (flattenTokenTree) Â· slots decrement	Winning user gets slot confirmation toast
12	Artifact registry (Sherd) list card + request modal	Original steward receives request
13	Sub-steward approval flow â†’ calendar badge	Assignment doc written; tokens transferred
14	Dashboard aggregation (Spotlight ranking by gratitudePotential) Â· Map pins Â· polish glass UI, gradients, toasts	End-to-end demo: create intention âžž switch âžž proof âžž assign âžž offering âžž accept âžž artifact request

Stretch (post-demo)
	â€¢	Mobile adaptive Tailwind breakpoints
	â€¢	Itinerary geofencing (match future way-points)
	â€¢	CRDT conflict tests (simulated offline edits)
	â€¢	Temple of Listening moderation queue

Definition of Done
	1.	Clone repo, run npm run dev, demo flows with two browser tabs and no manual DB resets.
	2.	All collections stored in local Orbit/IPFS; refresh persists data.
	3.	No unhandled promise rejections in console.
	4.	README includes setup instructions + magic-link test mail.
